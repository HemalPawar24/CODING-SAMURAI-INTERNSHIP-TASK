🌸 Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning 🌸
Just completed a hands-on project where I built and evaluated classification models using the classic Iris dataset 🌿

🔍 What I Did:
• Explored and visualized the dataset
• Preprocessed features with StandardScaler
• Trained models using:

K-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Tree Classifier
• Achieved 100% accuracy on the test set for both models 🎯

🧠 Skills Demonstrated:

Data exploration & cleaning

Model training & evaluation

Confusion matrix and classification report interpretation

Use of Scikit-learn and data visualization libraries

💡 This project strengthened my understanding of supervised learning and showed how effective simple models can be with clean, structured data.

📊 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
